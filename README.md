# scsnl-100lesson

This mini lesson was created for the Animaths project in the Stanford Cognitive Systems and Neuroscience Laboratory.

## About

Initially created through FlutterFlow, this project was made as a mini lesson to introduce children to number quantities up to and including 100. This lesson will accompany a suite of 7 games all aimed at helping children with mathematical dyscalculia improve their ability to subitize. This lesson first reviews numbers from 1 to 20, introduces children to numbers up to 100, and then gives kids a chance to play around with an interactive grid that shows a number as both its symbolic quantity, a group of dots, and a group of shaded boxes. Through all of this, kids will hopefully have a better number sense and will be better equipped to handle the more challenging problems in the advanced Animaths games.
